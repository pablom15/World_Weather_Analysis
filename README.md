## Challenge Objectives and Results
The objective of this analysis was to successfully utilize APIs and try-exept blocks in order to determine a potential list of cities for customers to visit on vacation. OpenWeatherMap was used to obtain a random list of cities while Google Maps Platform was used to obtain hotel names and map images. The data frame was filtered to cities within 70-90F temperature with no rain or snow fall. From this list of cities, the following four were determined optimal for a European road trip. 

Cities:
1. Vierzon, France
1. Saint-Orens-De-Gameville, France
1. Vila, Portugal
1. Lata, Portugal

### Results
Maps of the cities hotels and driving directions are shown as the results of this challenge.
